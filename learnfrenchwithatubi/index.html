                            Growing up in Nigeria, my exposure to languages was primarily confined to my native tongue. However, an insatiable curiosity for new linguistic horizons ignited within me. This fervor propelled me on a transformative odyssey to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where I resided for two pivotal years. It was there that my fascination with the French language and the rich tapestry of its accompanying culture truly took root.

                            Returning to Nigeria, I was stirred by an impassioned resolve to narrow the divide between communities and the French language. I harbored an earnest desire to elucidate the intricacies of French cultures and lifestyles. I firmly advocate that genuine language acquisition burgeons from immersive experiences, where one is fully steeped in both the linguistic nuances and the cultural ethos. For me, language serves not just as a vessel for culture but as an inseparable facet of it.
                            
                            Moreover, my unwavering belief endorses the idea that mastery of a language demands the courage to venture beyond one's comfort zone, particularly during the nascent stages of learning. 
                        </p>    
                        
                        <p class="paragraph-two">
                            Cultivating confidence becomes indispensable in the pursuit of linguistic proficiency, empowering one to navigate the challenges of acquiring a new language.
                            
                            This transformative journey has solidified my belief in the profound connection between language and culture, instilling in me a fervent dedication to foster cross-cultural understanding through the conduit of language acquisition.

                                I took french lesssons through Skype with Learn French with Atubi for about one year.
                                It works great and even my French friends are surprised to see how much progress i have made in one year. My teacher was full of energy and very passionate for teaching. 
                                furthermore, I could just relax at home with a glass of wine to learn and speak Parisioan accent French. It is a very pleasant and fun experience to learn Frenc from them and is highly reccommended!

                                Atubi's Knowledge of the French language and grammar rules is truly impressive- not only does he know the contect behind every rule he teaches, he can explain the same idea in five different ways(if you're like me and you didnt understand the first four times 
                                ,he will always be able to come up with another creative way of explaining it.) He truly has the patience of a Saint-no matter how many times he had to repeat a lessonwith me, there was always a smile on his face and a positive word if encouragement.
